## Getting The Code

### 1. Fork
If you're keen to contribute, start by [forking](https://github.com/setitheme/icons) the repo and cloning it to your computer.

**Note:** To use the development version, you must first install the production version (`apm uninstall seti-ui`), then and run the following commands:

```sh
$ cd path/to/this/repo/src
# To link the local version as an npm package
$ npm link .

# when you're done, be sure to unlink the local version so you are getting the official repo again
$ npm unlink .
```
