The seti theme was made to be a subtle but visually pleasing color scheme for text environments. It pairs a dark background with a carefully selected muted color palette. It was originally developed as a ui & syntax theme pair for [Atom](https://atom.io/), but is now in use one many differerant platforms.

It's evolded subtly over the years, but the core remains the same. At it's core, seti is just a collection of colors & icons, combined in a collection of packages.

The name is a nod to outer space and the SETI Institute on account of its darkness, but has no other affiliation.
